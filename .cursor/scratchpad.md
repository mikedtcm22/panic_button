# Improv Panic Button - Project Management

## Background and Motivation

The Improv Panic Button project is a web companion application for D&D Dungeon Masters that provides AI-powered improvisation assistance during live gameplay. The application allows DMs to upload campaign materials, process them into a searchable digest, and then use a radial panic button interface to quickly generate lore-consistent NPCs, encounters, plot redirects, and other content during sessions.

**Current Task**: Define iterative development phases from barebones setup to full MVP and beyond, creating a structured roadmap that builds functional capability incrementally.

**Key Project Requirements**:
- 5-hour free trial with subscription conversion
- Sub-3 second response times for canned prompts
- File upload and processing pipeline
- Five distinct panic prompt types (NPC, Filler Encounter, Redirect Plot, Flavor Detail, Foreshadow Hook)
- Session management with timer and history tracking
- AI-first codebase with 500-line file limit

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Architecture Challenges
1. **File Processing Pipeline**: Need to handle multiple file types (DOCX, PDF, MD, TXT) and convert to searchable embeddings
2. **AI Integration Complexity**: Balancing response speed, token costs, and content quality across 5 different prompt types
3. **Session State Management**: Managing active sessions, timers, and persistent context across user interactions
4. **Real-time Response Delivery**: Ensuring sub-3 second response times while maintaining quality

### User Experience Challenges
1. **Seamless Onboarding**: Users need to quickly understand value and complete setup
2. **Radial Interface Design**: Creating intuitive panic button with 5 distinct options
3. **Content Quality Assurance**: Ensuring AI responses feel native to user's campaign world
4. **Trial-to-Subscription Conversion**: Demonstrating value within 5-hour trial period

### Development Approach Challenges
1. **AI-First Architecture**: Following 500-line file limit while maintaining functionality
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase must deliver working product value
3. **Testing Strategy**: Ensuring AI responses and file processing work reliably
4. **Scalability Planning**: Building for eventual 1000+ paying users

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Barebones)
**Goal**: Establish basic technical infrastructure and prove core concepts
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Deliverable**: Minimal working application with authentication, file upload, and basic AI response

### Phase 2: Core MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
**Goal**: Complete user journey from upload to panic button usage
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Deliverable**: Fully functional application with all 5 panic prompts, session management, and billing

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
**Goal**: Polish user experience and add advanced functionality
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**Deliverable**: Production-ready application with encounter scaling, advanced session features, and optimizations

### Phase 4: Production & Scale
**Goal**: Full production deployment with monitoring and advanced features
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Deliverable**: Scalable production application with analytics, mobile responsiveness, and advanced AI features
