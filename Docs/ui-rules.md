# Improv Panic Button - UI Design Rules

## Overview
This document defines the core design principles and interaction patterns for the Improv Panic Button application. These rules ensure a consistent, professional, and stress-reducing experience for Dungeon Masters during both prep work and live sessions.

## Core Design Philosophy

### "Professional Gaming" Style
- **Sophisticated but approachable**: Balances gaming context with professional tool requirements
- **Function over flash**: Every design element serves a purpose
- **Stress-reducing**: Design choices actively reduce cognitive load during high-pressure moments
- **Trust-building**: Visual design reinforces confidence in AI-generated content

---

## Fundamental Design Principles

### 1. Invisible Until Needed
**Principle**: The interface should support gameplay without becoming a distraction.

**Applications**:
- Clean, uncluttered layouts with generous white space
- Subtle presence during prep phases, bold clarity during active use
- Progressive disclosure: show basic options first, advanced on demand
- Context-sensitive interfaces that adapt to user's current task

**Examples**:
- Session prep interface: calm, spacious layout
- Panic button interface: bold, immediately accessible
- Background processing: subtle progress indicators

### 2. Stress-Reducing Hierarchy
**Principle**: Visual hierarchy should guide users efficiently during high-stress moments.

**Applications**:
- Clear primary, secondary, and tertiary actions
- Consistent positioning of critical elements
- Calming colors for prep work, confident colors for active states
- Predictable interaction patterns to build muscle memory

**Hierarchy Rules**:
1. **Primary**: Panic button, main CTA, critical actions
2. **Secondary**: Navigation, session info, context panels
3. **Tertiary**: Settings, metadata, supplementary information

### 3. Rapid Recognition
**Principle**: Users must understand interface elements instantly (< 3s response time requirement).

**Applications**:
- High contrast for quick scanning
- Familiar iconography and patterns
- Clear affordances (buttons look clickable, inputs look editable)
- Immediate visual feedback for all interactions

**Recognition Standards**:
- Icons must be understandable without labels
- Button purposes must be clear from appearance
- Status indicators must be immediately interpretable

### 4. Radial-First Design
**Principle**: The core interaction is radial, so the entire interface should feel cohesive.

**Applications**:
- Circular elements and flowing curves throughout
- Five-point symmetry reflecting panic prompt types
- Radial gradients and arc-based layouts where appropriate
- Gesture-friendly interaction areas (minimum 44px touch targets)

### 5. Content-Forward Design
**Principle**: The AI-generated content is the star; the interface is the supporting cast.

**Applications**:
- Typography optimized for reading campaign content
- Generous margins around content areas
- Subtle backgrounds that don't compete with text
- Clear distinction between user content and AI suggestions

- Tablet: 768px+ (secondary priority)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (primary target)
- Large Desktop: 1440px+ (primary target)

### Container Rules
- **Max Width**: 1200px for main content areas
- **Margins**: 24px minimum on mobile, 48px on desktop
- **Content Width**: 65-75 characters for readable text blocks
- **Card Spacing**: 24px between cards, 16px within cards

### Z-Index System
